# Image-Processing
Image Processing, NYCU CS, Fall 2022

Use toolbox/library functions only for:
- Image reading, writing, and display.
- Color space conversion.
- Matrix operations not specific to images.
- Image resizing

## HW1
Enhance the supplied images using techniques of contrast adjustment, noise reduction, color correction, and so on.

## HW2
### Canny edge detector
- Experiment with different ways to get candidate edge points, choices of the two thresholds, and effects of preprocessing such as smoothing and sharpening. 
- Also can experiment with color images.
- Compare results with the canny edge detection results from existing library/toolbox functions.
